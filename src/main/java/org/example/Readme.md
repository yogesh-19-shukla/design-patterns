# 🎯 Java Design Patterns – SDE-2 Level

This repository contains full working Java implementations of commonly asked **Object-Oriented Design Patterns**, categorized by:

- ✅ **Creational Patterns**
- ✅ **Structural Patterns**
- ✅ **Behavioral Patterns**

Each pattern includes:
- 📘 Problem intent
- ✅ Complete working code
- 🔁 Real-world analogy
- 🧪 Output test in `Main.java`

## 🏗️ Creational Design Patterns

> These patterns focus on how objects are **created**, hiding the complexity of object creation and instantiating based on the situation.

| Pattern            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Factory**         | Creates objects without exposing creation logic to the client |
| **Abstract Factory**| Produces families of related objects without specifying exact classes |
| **Singleton**       | Ensures only one instance of a class exists in the system |
| **Builder**         | Builds complex objects step-by-step using a separate builder class |
| **Prototype**       | Clones existing objects instead of creating new ones from scratch |

---

## 🧱 Structural Design Patterns

> These patterns deal with how classes and objects are **composed** to form larger structures and interfaces.

| Pattern        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Adapter**     | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together (Wrapper) |
| **Decorator**   | Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically without modifying the class |

---

## 🔁 Behavioral Design Patterns

> These patterns define how objects **communicate** and interact with each other at runtime.

| Pattern                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Strategy**           | Defines interchangeable algorithms encapsulated as objects |
| **Observer**           | One-to-many relationship; subject notifies observers of changes |
| **Command**            | Encapsulates a request as an object, enabling undo/redo |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes requests through a chain of handlers until one handles it |
